## Neighborhood Map

> This is the fifth project of the [Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004/) program, from Udacity.



### Overview

The goal with this project is to implement a one page app listing locations on a map, providing information from more than one API provider, in a responsive manner. The data model framework to be used in [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/index.html), and the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html) has to be followed as well.



#### Chosen theme

My version of this project was named **'my home town'** for a reason: it shows places from the city where I grew up, like schools that I've attended, or gyms that I used to workout, or parks that I loved to go. A total of 18 places were hard coded into the `js/places.js` with their names, addresses and an additional personal info/comment on every and each of them, and they were divided into different types, which are used in the location filter: education, sports, parks, local shops and food places (which includes restaurants, coffee shops and others).
